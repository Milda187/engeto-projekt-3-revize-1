      <h2 class="h2-about-football">About football</h2>
      <p>
         Football is a collective ball game that is the most popular collective sport in the world. 
         In football, two teams of eleven players each play on a rectangular, usually grassy field. 
         Their goal is to score more goals than the opponent. A goal is scored when the ball crosses 
         the goal line between the goal posts with its full volume. It is mainly played with the feet, 
         but players can use any part of their body except hands and arms to play the ball. Only the 
         goalkeeper (i.e. one of the players, distinguished by the color of the jersey) can also play 
         with his hands near his own goal.
      </p>

<!-- *************************** GAME SECTION *************************** -->
<section class="game-section">
   <div class="mobile-content desktop-content">
      <h2 class="h2-game">Game</h2>
      <p>
         Two teams of eleven players each participate in the game. The game is overseen by a referee: 
         the head referee moves between the players on the playing field and has full responsibility 
         for managing the match; it is equipped with a whistle that signals the start and stop of the game. 
         Just beyond the edge of the playing area on the longer edges of the field, there are two assistant 
         referees who signal some types of violations to the main referee with a flag, but they do not have 
         independent decision-making authority. In some competitions, there are also two additional referees, 
         the so-called goal referees, standing outside the pitch just next to each goal; they do not directly 
         interfere in the game and do not even have a flag, they function as advisors to the main referee, 
         with whom they are connected by a mini radio.
      </p>
      <p>
         It is played with a single round ball that the players move around the playing field: by "dribbling" 
         (running with the ball controlled by soft kicks), passing to teammates and finally shooting at the 
         opponent's goal, which is defended by the opponent's goalkeeper. The team that is not currently in 
         control of the ball tries to get it: by intercepting the opponent's pass or "tackle" the opponent 
         who has the ball; however, the allowed physical contact between players is significantly limited.
      </p>
      <p>
         A football match generally runs smoothly, interruptions are caused by violations of the rules 
         (e.g. when the ball goes outside the playing area, when a player outside the goalkeeper plays with 
         his hand, when trying to take the ball from the opponent, a player kicks the opponent or otherwise 
         exceeds the permitted methods of tackling, etc.) and the game after them, it usually continues with 
         only a small delay. A total of ninety minutes of rough time is played (time also runs in interrupted 
         play), with a fifteen-minute break in the middle, after which the opponents switch halves of the 
         field. At the end of both halves, the referee determines how much time will be played beyond the 
         45 minutes, making up for time lost e.g. by treating injured players or substitutions. Typically 
         this is about one minute at the end of the first half and three minutes at the end of the second 
         half.
      </p>
      <p>
         After the end of the second half, the team that scored more goals against the opponent is the winner 
         of the match. If both teams have scored the same number of goals, the match ends in a draw; however, 
         in some competitions, a tie is inadmissible and the game must be decided, usually by 2x15 minutes 
         of extra time, and if there is no decision even after that, a penalty shootout follows. In modern 
         football, relatively few goals are scored, for example at the World Cup 2006 the average was 2.3 
         goals per match.
      </p>
      <p>
         From the eleven players of each team, one is designated as the goalkeeper according to the rules: 
         he has a different jersey color and the exception applies to him that he is allowed to play the 
         ball with his hands in the vicinity of his own goal. From the point of view of the rules, all other 
         players are the same, but in practice, specialized functions have been developed given the specific 
         abilities of individual players, tactical intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
         Dividing the players into individual positions and determining their tasks and general game tactics 
         is the coach's responsibility. During the match, the coaches of both teams stay near the edge of 
         the playing area (near the center of one longer edge), give advice and instructions to the players 
         on the field and, if necessary, replace players on the field with substitutes. Between the two 
         substitutes' benches, there is a fourth referee who controls the substitutions, checks the compliance 
         of the people on the benches, and in case of injury to one of the three referees on the pitch, he 
         can replace the injured referee.

<section class="playground">
   <div class="mobile-content desktop-content">
      <h2 class="dimensions">Playground</h2>
      <p>
         Football is played on a rectangular playing field . The length must be in the range of 90–120 m, 
         width 45–90 m (for international matches 100–110 × 64–75 m; specific professional competitions 
         usually set even more precise boundaries, e.g. pitches in stadiums of categories 3–4 according 
         to UEFA have fixed dimensions of 105 × 68 m). The playing surface is marked with (usually white) 
         lines (max. line width 12 cm): boundary lines define the longer edge of the playing surface, 
         shorter ones are called goal lines . The playing surface is divided into halves by a center line, 
         in the center of which is marked a center mark , around which a center circle is marked. 
         Furthermore, penalty areas and smaller goal areas are marked on each half of the playing area 
         near the respective goal . A penalty marker is marked inside each penalty area. Furthermore, 
         a part of a circular arc is marked outside the penalty area with its center in the penalty mark 
         and a radius of 9.15 m (10 yards ).
      </p>
      <p>
         A flag is placed on a flexible pole at least 1.5 m high in each corner of the playing area. 
         The same flags are usually also placed in the middle of both boundary lines. A quarter circle 
         is marked around each corner flag on the playing field. The distance of 9.15 m from the corner 
         flag is usually also marked with short marks on the goal lines.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the middle of both goal lines, there are goals, formed by two vertical goal posts, which 
         are connected at the top by a crossbar. All sticks must be white and have the same width 
         (max. 12 cm), which must be the same as the width of the goal line. The inside dimensions of the 
         goal are 7.32×2.44 m (8 yards×8 feet ). A net is attached to the goal structure, which must be 
         fixed to the posts, crossbars and the ground so that the ball cannot pass through. The net is 
         turned off at the back so that it does not restrict the movement of the goalkeeper.

      <h2 class="competitions-h2">Competitions</h2>
      <p>
         In football, there is a large number of competitions both international and in individual 
         states or their parts.
      </p>
      <h3 class="International-competitions-h3">International competitions</h3>
      <p>
         On the international level, the national teams of individual countries (almost all countries have 
         their own football teams) and private football clubs from different countries compete against each 
         other.
      </p>
      <p>
         The highest international competition for national teams is the World Cup, held every four years, 
         in the final tournament of which 32 teams compete, selected by qualifiers from more than 200 FIFA 
         member states. The football tournament is also part of the program of the Summer Olympics; however, 
         this tournament currently features youth teams of players under the age of 23, so the tournament 
         does not have as much prestige as the World Cup.
      </p>
      <p>
         After the World Cup, the most important representative competitions are the regional championships 
         organized by individual confederations. These are the European Championship (EURO), Copa América, 
         Africa Cup of Nations, Asian Football Championship, CONCACAF Gold Cup and Oceania Cup of Nations.
      </p>
      <p>
         Regional confederations also organize the most important club competitions. The winners of national 
         eagues and cups participate in these (possibly also participants in other places). These include 
         the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League and the European Conference League in Europe, 
         the Liberators Cup in South America, the AFC Champions League in Asia, the CAF Champions League 
         in Africa, the CONCACAF Champions League in North America and the OFC Champions League in Oceania. 
         The winner of the UEFA Champions League and the Cup of Liberators have competed annually in the 
         Intercontinental Cup, but since 2005 it has been replaced by the FIFA Club World Cup.
      </p>
      <h3 class="National-competitions-h3">National competitions</h3>
      <p>
         Most national associations organize national competitions, in larger states there are usually at 
         least two competitions with different formats: one is a league competition divided according to 
         performance, each performance group is played on a round-robin basis and the winner is decided by 
         points in the match table; the highest placed teams can advance to a higher competition, the lowest, 
         on the other hand, go down a level. The second competition is usually the national cup, in which all 
         teams meeting a certain minimum performance level can participate under equal conditions, it is 
         played on a knock-out system - the winner advances to the next round of the competition, the team 
         that lost ends in the competition for the given year.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the Czech Republic, the highest league competition is the first league, alongside which there 
         is a cup (currently referred to as the MOL Cup).
      </p>
      <p>
         The most famous league competitions in the world include the English Premier League, the Spanish 
         Primera división, the Italian Serie A, the German Bundesliga, the French Ligue 1 Orange and the 
         Brazilian Serie A.
      </p>
      <h3 class="Czech-republic-competitions-h3">The system of competitions in the Czech Republic</h3>
      <p>
         Men's football club competitions in the Czech Republic are divided into several levels. At the 
         highest level are national professional competitions (1st and 2nd leagues), at the lowest level 
         are the III. and IV. classes, organized regionally (by district football associations).

      <h2 class="czechia-h2">Czechia</h2>
      <p>
         In the Czech Republic, football originated in Bohemia between 1890 and 1900, mainly played by 
         Germans (the country was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire). The best German club was called 
         Regatta Prag. The first known football match in the Czech Republic occurred on the islet located 
         in the Labe River in Roudnice nad Labem in 1887.In 1896 the first derby between SK Slavia 
         Prague and AC Sparta Prague was disputed with the result of 0–1. In 1896, the first Czech 
         championship, won by CFK Kickers Prague (spring) and Deutscher FC Prag (autumn) was disputed. 
         In 1897 the Czech Crown championship was won, won by Slavia and in 1902 the Czech Football 
         Association championship won by the Cesky AFC Vinohrady. Czechoslovak First League was the 
         premier football league in the Czechoslovakia from 1925 to 1993. In 1901 the Czech Football 
         Federation was created.[8] Between 1903 and 1908, the selection of soccer of Bohemia disputed 
         seven international parties. Subsequently, between 1922 and 1993, the selection and federation 
         of the Czech Republic became the respective ones of Czechoslovakia. As of this last year, the 
         organizations of the Czech Republic revived, again as an independent state.
